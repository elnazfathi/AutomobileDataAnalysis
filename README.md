# AutomobileDataAnalysis
Data analysis and wrangling approaches
This python code applies initial analysis of a "cars" dataset. The main goal is to get familiar with Numpy and Pandas tools in addition to Matplotlib and seaborn visualization packages to get initial insights of data and apply simple data cleaning approaches.
The data file "auto.csv" should be saved in a folder called "Data" in the same folder where the Python file is stored. The reason is the data file path used in pd.read_csv() is using the mentioned folder path.

The EDA Python file includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on "automobileEDA.csv" dataset which is almost the same as the first "auto.csv" dataset but with initial cleanup applied to it.
